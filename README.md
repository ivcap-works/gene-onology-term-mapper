# 📘 Tutorial: Building a Gene Ontology (GO) Term Mapper Tool for the IVCAP Platform

## What should it do?

Maps genes or proteins to GO terms using a local or remote database (e.g., UniProt or QuickGO), optionally builds a graph.

* Input: List of gene symbols
* Output: GO terms and categories
* Bonus: Build a GO hierarchy using networkx

## Core Workflow

* Input: List of gene/protein IDs (e.g. UniProt IDs or gene symbols)
* Query: Use QuickGO or UniProt API to fetch GO annotations
* Filter: Select GO terms by category (BP, MF, CC)
* Output: JSON of GO annotations per gene
* Optional: Visualize GO hierarchy using networkx

## Sample Questions for an Agent using this tool

These are typical user-facing queries an AI assistant might receive:

* "What are the biological functions of genes TP53, AKT1, and MCM10?"
<br>→ Agent maps the gene symbols to UniProt IDs (if needed) and calls map_go_terms.

* "List GO terms for protein Q9H0H5 involved in cellular components."
<br>→ Uses map_go_terms(ids=["Q9H0H5"], category="CC").

* "Give me all molecular functions associated with proteins P12345 and Q96GD4."

* "Which GO terms are shared between these proteins?"
<br>→ Agent may call map_go_terms and perform post-processing to find overlaps.


## 🧰 Prerequisites

Before starting, ensure you have the following installed:

- Python 3.9+
- Git (for cloning repositories)
- Docker to build the service container
- `curl` or `wget` (for downloading binaries)



The rest of the turial is broken up into multiple steps:

- [Step 1: Install Poetry and IVCAP plugin](#step1)
- [Step 2: Install `ivcap` CLI Tool](#step2)
- [Step 3: Create Your Project Structure with Poetry](#step3)
- [Step 4: Add and install Dependencies](#step4)
- [Step 5: Implement the Core Functionality](#step5)
- [Step 6: Implement the IVCAP Service Wrapper](#step6)
- [Step 7: Run and test locally](#step7)
- [Step 8: Deploying to IVCAP](#step8)
- [Step 9: Testing the service on IVCAP](#step9)

Let's begin!

---

## Step 1: Install Poetry and IVCAP plugin <a name="step1"></a>

Poetry is a modern dependency and packaging manager for Python.

```bash
curl -sSL https://install.python-poetry.org | python3 -
```

After installation, make sure Poetry is in your `PATH`:

```bash
export PATH="$HOME/.local/bin:$PATH"
```

Confirm installation:

```bash
poetry --version
```

Add the ICAP plugin to poetry:

```bash
poetry self add poetry-plugin-ivcap
```

ANd confirm the installation of the plugin:

```bash
poetry ivcap version
```
---
## Step 2: Install `ivcap` CLI Tool <a name="step2"></a>

The application relies on the `ivcap` CLI. Install and build instructions can be found on [github](https://github.com/ivcap-works/ivcap-cli). A list of pre-built binaries can be found [here](https://github.com/ivcap-works/ivcap-cli/releases/latest).

### For macOS/Linux

If you use [homebrew](https://brew.sh/), you can install it by:

```
brew tap ivcap-works/ivcap
brew install ivcap
```

### For Windows (PowerShell):

```powershell
Invoke-WebRequest -Uri https://github.com/ivcap-works/ivcap-cli/releases/latest/download/ivcap-Windows-amd64.exe -OutFile ivcap.exe
Move-Item ivcap.exe 'C:\Program Files\ivcap\ivcap.exe'
# Add C:\Program Files\ivcap to your PATH if necessary
```

Verify installation:

```bash
ivcap --help
```

To configure it for a specific IVCAP deployment, follow [these instructions](https://github.com/ivcap-works/ivcap-cli?tab=readme-ov-file#configure-context-for-a-specific-deployment). For instance, to connect to the SD dev deployment, you can use (`sd-dev` is  a local alias, pick whatever makes it easy for you to remember, in case you work across multiple platofrm instancies):

```bash
ivcap context create sd-dev https://develop.ivcap.net
```

After setting up a specific context, please log in before proceeding. The ivcap poetry plugin is using the cli tool to communicate with the selected platform.

```bash
ivcap context login
```

If you have trouble logging in, see these [more detailed descriptions](https://github.com/ivcap-works/ivcap-cli?tab=readme-ov-file#configure-context-for-a-specific-deployment). For problems creating the initial accounts, please refer
to the individual platforms' support channels.

---

## Step 3: Create Your Project Structure with Poetry <a name="step3"></a>

```bash
poetry new my_app
cd my_app
```

This creates:

```
my_app/
├── pyproject.toml
├── README.rst
├── my_app/
│   └── __init__.py
└── tests/
    └── __init__.py
```

> **Important:** Please open `pyproject.toml` in an editor and change the line `requires-python = ">=3.xx"` to `requires-python = ">=3.xx,<4.0"` where `xx` is your current python version (eg. 9, 10, 11, 12, ...). This is needed for version compatibility checks when adding dependencies in the next step.
---

## Step 4: Add and install Dependencies <a name="step4"></a>

```bash
poetry add httpx pydantic ivcap-ai-tool
```

> **Note:** If this results in errors like _"The current project's supported Python range (>=3.12) is not compatible with ..."_ make sure you have edited the `pyproject.toml` as instructed above.

To install the packages, run:

```bash
poetry install --no-root
```

---

## Step 5: Implement the Core Functionality <a name="step5"></a>

The base functionality will be provided by a function `fetch_go_terms(uniprot_id: str) -> List[Annotation]`
which takes a protein ID as argument and returns a list of annotations. It uses the
[Gene Ontology and GO Annotations (QuickGO)](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/QuickGO/) service to retrieve the
annotations.

Let's open a new file `go_term_fetcher.py` and add the following:

```python
async def fetch_go_terms(uniprot_id: str) -> List[Annotation]:
    """Fetch the annotations for 'uniprot_id' from the QuickGO service."""
    url = f"https://www.ebi.ac.uk/QuickGO/services/annotation/search"
    params = {
        "geneProductId": f"UniProtKB:{uniprot_id}",
        "limit": 100
    }
    async with httpx.AsyncClient() as client:
        resp = await client.get(url, params=params)
        resp.raise_for_status()
        data = resp.json()
        results = [Annotation(**d) for d in data["results"]]
        return results

def filter_by_category(go_terms: List[Annotation], category: str) -> List[Annotation]:
    """If 'category' is in GO_CATEGORIES, filter the go_terms by that category."""
    if category not in GO_CATEGORIES:
        return go_terms
    return [t for t in go_terms if t.goAspect == GO_CATEGORIES[category]]
```

We also need to import some libraries as well as define the _shape_ of the
returned annotations. Add the following to the top of `go_term_fetcher.py`:

```python
import httpx
from typing import List, Dict, Optional
from pydantic import BaseModel

GO_CATEGORIES = {
    "BP": "biological_process",
    "MF": "molecular_function",
    "CC": "cellular_component",
}

class Annotation(BaseModel):
    id: Optional[str] = None
    geneProductId: Optional[str] = None
    qualifier: Optional[str] = None
    goId: Optional[str] = None
    goAspect: Optional[str] = None
    goEvidence: Optional[str] = None
    goName: Optional[str] = None
    assignedBy: Optional[str] = None
    symbol: Optional[str] = None
    synonyms: Optional[str] = None
    name: Optional[str] = None
    reference: Optional[str] = None
```

To test our progress so far, we add some code to verify that this is working to the end
of `go_term_fetcher.py`:

```python
if __name__ == "__main__":
    import asyncio
    import json
    from fastapi.encoders import jsonable_encoder

    async def main():
        terms = await fetch_go_terms("P12345")
        print(json.dumps([jsonable_encoder(term) for term in terms[:3]], indent=2))
    asyncio.run(main())
```

And now, let's test it by executing `poetry run python go_term_fetcher.py`:

```bash
% poetry run python go_term_fetcher.py
[
  {
    "id": "UniProtKB:P12345!306410571",
    "geneProductId": "UniProtKB:P12345",
    "qualifier": "enables",
    "goId": "GO:0003824",
    "goAspect": "molecular_function",
    "goEvidence": "IEA",
    "goName": null,
    "assignedBy": "InterPro",
    "symbol": "GOT2",
    "synonyms": null,
    "name": null,
    "reference": "GO_REF:0000002"
  },
  {
    "id": "UniProtKB:P12345!306410572",
    "geneProductId": "UniProtKB:P12345",
    "qualifier": "enables",
    "goId": "GO:0004069",
    "goAspect": "molecular_function",
    "goEvidence": "ISS",
    "goName": null,
    "assignedBy": "UniProt",
    "symbol": "GOT2",
    "synonyms": null,
    "name": null,
    "reference": "GO_REF:0000024"
  },
  {
    "id": "UniProtKB:P12345!306410573",
    "geneProductId": "UniProtKB:P12345",
    "qualifier": "enables",
    "goId": "GO:0004069",
    "goAspect": "molecular_function",
    "goEvidence": "IEA",
    "goName": null,
    "assignedBy": "UniProt",
    "symbol": "GOT2",
    "synonyms": null,
    "name": null,
    "reference": "GO_REF:0000120"
  }
]
```

---

## Step 6: Implement the IVCAP Service Wrapper <a name="step6"></a>

Our tool is stateless as well as requires little computational resources. In fact, most of the run time
will be spent to wait for the reply from the remote _QuickGO_ service. In short it can easily process many requests in
parallel and is an excellent candidate for a FaaS type service. In practical terms, we will implement a web service
which will receive requests as `POST` events and return the result in JOSN format.

Therefore, our plan is as follows:

* Add a `tool.poetry-plugin-ivcap` section to `pyproject.toml`
* Create a new file `service.py`
* Describe the service (`Service(...)`)
* Define the Request as well as Result models
* Implement the IVCAP service wrapper around the previously defined `fetch_go_terms` function
* Add code to start the server

In `pyproject.toml`, add:

```toml
[tool.poetry-plugin-ivcap]
service-file = "service.py"
service-type = "lambda"
port = 8077
```

Now, let's open a new file `service.py` and add the following sections to that file:

### Heasders and logging setup

```python
import os
from typing import List, Dict, Optional
import asyncio
from pydantic import BaseModel, ConfigDict, Field
from ivcap_service import getLogger, Service
from ivcap_ai_tool import start_tool_server, logging_init, ToolOptions, ivcap_ai_tool

from go_term_fetcher import Annotation, fetch_go_terms, filter_by_category

logging_init()
logger = getLogger("app")
```

### Service description

```python
service = Service(
    name="Gene Ontology (GO) Term Mapper",
    version=os.environ.get("VERSION", "???"),
    contact={
        "name": "Mary Doe",
        "email": "mary.doe@acme.au",
    },
)
```

### Request and Result model

We already have implemented our function, but need more formally define the _shape_ or _schema_ of the incoming request
as well as the reply. For that, we will add the two models `Request` and `Result`
using the additional functionality from the [Pydantic](https://docs.pydantic.dev/latest/) library to
make them more self-descriptive:


```python
class Request(BaseModel):
    jschema: str = Field("urn:sd:schema.gene-ontology-term-mapper.request.1", alias="$schema")
    ids: List[str] = Field(description="List of UniProt IDs")
    category: Optional[str] = Field(None, description="GO category: BP, MF, or CC")

    model_config = ConfigDict(json_schema_extra={
        "example": {
            "$schema": "urn:sd:schema.gene-ontology-term-mapper.request.1",
            "ids": [ "P12345", "Q9H0H5" ],
            "category": "BP"
        }
    })

class Result(BaseModel):
    jschema: str = Field("urn:sd:schema.gene-ontology-term-mapper.1", alias="$schema")
    results: Dict[str, List[Annotation]] = Field(description="contains a list of annotations for every UniProt ID")

    model_config = ConfigDict(
        json_schema_extra={
            "example": {
                "$schema": "urn:sd:schema.gene-ontology-term-mapper.1",
                "results": {
                    "P12345": [{
                        "id": "UniProtKB:P12345!296618610",
                        "geneProductId": "UniProtKB:P12345",
                        "qualifier": "involved_in",
                        "goId": "GO:0006103",
                        "goAspect": "biological_process",
                        "goEvidence": "ISS",
                        "assignedBy": "UniProt",
                        "symbol": "GOT2",
                        "reference": "GO_REF:0000024"
                    }]
                }
            }
        },
    )
```

### The service wrapper

We now implement the "wrapper" function which takes the above `Request` instance, calls the previously defined
`fetch_go_terms` function for each of the requested UniProt IDs and assembles the result. Please note that we
are adding a quite extensive 'doc_string' to the function. The IVCAP SDK will use this as the tool description
accessible to the various agent frameworks.

```python
@ivcap_ai_tool("/", opts=ToolOptions(tags=["GO Term Mapper"]))
async def map_go_terms(
    req: Request
) -> Result:
    """This function maps a set of protein or gene identifiers (typically UniProt IDs)
    to their corresponding Gene Ontology (GO) annotations using the QuickGO REST API.
    It can filter results by specific GO categories and is optimized for
    multi-ID batch processing.

    Supported high-level are:
    * GO categories are Biological Process (BP)
    * Molecular Function (MF)
    * Cellular Component (CC)

    Typical use-cases for this function are:
    * Enriching gene or protein datasets with structured functional annotations
    * Supporting biological data exploration or hypothesis generation
    * Downstream graph or network construction for biological analysis
"""
    results = {}

    async def fetch_and_filter(uid):
        terms = await fetch_go_terms(uid)
        filtered = filter_by_category(terms, req.category) if req.category else terms
        results[uid] = filtered

    await asyncio.gather(*(fetch_and_filter(i) for i in req.ids))
    return Result(results=results)
```

### Code to start the server

```python
if __name__ == "__main__":
    start_tool_server(service)
```

---

## Step 7: Run and test locally <a name="step7"></a>

In one terminal window, start the service:

```bash
poetry ivcap run
```

which should look like:

```bash
% poetry ivcap run
Running: poetry run python service.py --port 8077
2025-06-02T09:54:13+1000 INFO (app): Gene Ontology (GO) Term Mapper - 0.1.0|9083543|2025-06-02T09:54:12+10:00 - v0.7.6
2025-06-02T09:54:13+1000 INFO (uvicorn): Started server process [22445]
2025-06-02T09:54:13+1000 INFO (uvicorn): Waiting for application startup.
2025-06-02T09:54:13+1000 INFO (uvicorn): Application startup complete.
2025-06-02T09:54:13+1000 INFO (uvicorn): Uvicorn running on http://0.0.0.0:8077 (Press CTRL+C to quit)
```

To test the service, we need to first define a request. For that, open a new file `two_bp.json` and add the following:

```json
{
  "$schema": "urn:sd:schema.gene-ontology-term-mapper.request.1",
  "ids": [
    "P12345",
    "Q9H0H5"
  ],
  "category": "BP"
}
```

In a different terminal window, use `curl` (or `wget`) to directly call the service:

```bash
curl -X POST \
    -H "content-type: application/json" \
    -H "timeout: 60" \
    --data @two_bp.json \
    http://localhost:8077
```

Adding a json formatter, like `jq` should give us a nicely formatter reply:

```bash
% curl -X POST \
    -H "content-type: application/json" \
    -H "timeout: 60" \
    --data @tests/two_bp.json \
    http://localhost:8077 | jq
  % Total    % Received % Xferd  Average Speed   Time    Time     Time  Current
                                 Dload  Upload   Total   Spent    Left  Speed
100 10031  100  9907  100   124   4968     62  0:00:02  0:00:01  0:00:01  5028
{
  "$schema": "urn:sd:schema.gene-ontology-term-mapper.1",
  "results": {
    "P12345": [
      {
        "id": "UniProtKB:P12345!306410578",
        "geneProductId": "UniProtKB:P12345",
        "qualifier": "involved_in",
        "goId": "GO:0006103",
        "goAspect": "biological_process",
        "goEvidence": "ISS",
        "goName": null,
        "assignedBy": "UniProt",
        "symbol": "GOT2",
        "synonyms": null,
        "name": null,
        "reference": "GO_REF:0000024"
      },
      ...
```

---

## Step 8: Deploying to IVCAP <a name="step8"></a>

To deploy a service or tool to IVCAP, we need to do the following:

* Build and publish the service as a Docker container
* Register the service
* Register the service as a tool

### Build and publish the service as a Docker container

To package the code we have developed so far into a docker container, we first need to
create a Dockerfile. Open a file named `Dockerfile` and add the following:

```dockerfile
FROM python:3.10-slim-buster

RUN pip install poetry

WORKDIR /app
COPY pyproject.toml poetry.lock ./
RUN poetry config virtualenvs.create false && poetry install --no-root

COPY . .

# VERSION INFORMATION
ARG VERSION ???
ENV VERSION=$VERSION
ENV PORT=80

# Command to run
ENTRYPOINT ["python",  "/app/service.py"]
```

To test our setup, we will first build the docker image locally:

```bash
poetry ivcap docker-build
```

You should see something like:
```bash
% poetry ivcap docker-build
INFO: docker buildx build -t gene_onology_term_mapper_arm64:9a9a7cc --platform linux/arm64 --build-arg VERSION=0.1.0|9a9a7cc|2025-05-29T08:48:39+10:00 --build-arg BUILD_PLATFORM=linux/arm64 -f /Dockerfile --load .
[+] Building 43.3s (1/10)
 => [internal] load build definition from Dockerfile
 => => transferring dockerfile: 441B
 => [internal] load metadata for docker.io/library/python:3.10-slim-buster
 ...
 INFO: Docker build completed successfully
```

You can test the docker image with:
```bash
poetry ivcap docker-run
```

This should create a service listening on the same port as in the above "Run and test locally" step. The same 'curl' (or 'wget') tests should succeed and return the same results.

After verifying that the docker container build successfully, we can now deploy it:

```
poetry ivcap docker-publish
```

This may build a new container if your CPU architecture is different to the one of the respective IVCAP cluster. This is likely the case if your development machine is using an ARM CPU (like Apple Silicon).

You should see something similar to:
```bash
$ poetry ivcap docker-publish
INFO: docker buildx build -t gene_onology_term_mapper_amd64:9a9a7cc --platform linux/amd64 --build-arg VERSION=0.2.0|b4dbd44|2025-05-28T16:27:56+10:00 --build-arg BUILD_PLATFORM=linux/amd64 -f Dockerfile --load .
[+] Building 0.9s (14/14) FINISHED

INFO: package push completed successfully
```

### Register the service

To register this tool we can again simply invoke the respective poetry command:

```bash
poetry ivcap service-register
```

### Register the service as AI tool

To make this service discoverable by AI agents operating on the platform, we need to
upload the necessary description of this service to IVCAP. The `poetry ivcap service-register` command will create that description from the doc-string of the `map_go_terms` function
as well as its parameters. It is therefore very important to not only provide comprehensive
description of the core service function, but also add sufficient descriptions and examples to the parameter declarations. The above `Request` and `Result` models provide a good example on how to do this.

```bash
poetry ivcap tool-register
```
---

## Step 9: Testing the service on IVCAP <a name="step9"></a>

To test the service we have deployed in the previous step we can follow the same sequence as in
[Step 7: Run and test locally](#step7). We can use the same test request `two_bp.json`.

```bash
TOKEN=$(ivcap context get access-token --refresh-token); \
URL=$(ivcap context get url)/1/services2/$(poetry ivcap --silent get-service-id)/jobs; \
curl -i -X POST \
    -H "content-type: application/json" \
    -H "Authorization: Bearer ${TOKEN}" \
    -H "timeout: 60" \
    --data @two_bp.json \
    ${URL}
```

To combine that with `jq`, we should see something like (note the missing `-i`):
```
% TOKEN=$(ivcap context get access-token --refresh-token); \
URL=$(ivcap context get url)/1/services2/$(poetry ivcap --silent get-service-id)/jobs; \
curl -X POST \
    -H "content-type: application/json" \
    -H "Authorization: Bearer ${TOKEN}" \
    -H "timeout: 60" \
    --data @two_bp.json \
    ${URL} |jq
  % Total    % Received % Xferd  Average Speed   Time    Time     Time  Current
                                 Dload  Upload   Total   Spent    Left  Speed
100 10031    0  9907  100   124   3764     47  0:00:02  0:00:02 --:--:--  3811

  "results": {
    "P12345": [
      {
        "id": "UniProtKB:P12345!306410578",
        "geneProductId": "UniProtKB:P12345",
        "qualifier": "involved_in",
        "goId": "GO:0006103",
        "goAspect": "biological_process",
        "goEvidence": "ISS",
        "goName": null,
        "assignedBy": "UniProt",
        "symbol": "GOT2",
        "synonyms": null,
        "name": null,
        "reference": "GO_REF:0000024"
      },
      ...
```
